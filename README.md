# HA Awtrix

This component uses the MQTT API of [Awtrix](https://blueforcer.github.io/awtrix3/#/) in Home Assistant easily by adding several additional actions.

## Installation

### HACS

You can add the component automatically using HACS by clicking the following link:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=miguelangellv&repository=ha-awtrix&category=integration)

### Manual

You can install the component manually by copying the contents of the `custom_components/ha_awtrix` folder into the `custom_components` folder of your configuration.

## Configuration

Once installed, go to _Devices and Services -> Add Integration_ and search for _Awtrix_. After adding it, you will have the new actions available.

You MUST have configured your device MQTT settings to connect correctly to your mqtt server before being able to see the device using the awtrix actions bellow. If you skip this step you'll have "no matching device" message in the dropdown menu of the actions.

Ex. 

<img width="461" height="286" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c20324f-13e6-48f4-9ff4-26df2b796613" />

Click, save configurations and then Restart ESP. You can use default mqtt user/pass but it's a good security practice to add one dedicated to this device in the addon configuration.

## Actions

### Awtrix Settings

The `awtrix.settings` action allows you to configure various parameters of the Awtrix display, such as brightness, clock settings, enabling and disabling applications, etc.

### Awtrix Notification

The `awtrix.notification` action allows you to send notifications to the Awtrix display. It has many options to customize the notification according to your needs.

### Awtrix Custom APP

The `awtrix.custom_app` action allows you to create and update custom Awtrix applications. You can create custom applications with various elements such as text, icons, etc.
